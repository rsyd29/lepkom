# lepkom
This is my first project, "The application creates a login system using codeigniter 3 and bootstrap 4. You must create a database with the name "lepkom", import the file "lepkom.sql" in "phpmyadmin", and the file "lepkom" put in the "C:\xampp\htdocs" folder on local disk C or where you put the htdocs folder, Thank you.
